# Mirror of owlmale.neocities.org
Due to [my website](https://owlman.neocities.org) having an open, Creative Comments license, it was (and still is) possible for people to mirror, edit, and build off of it, and that's exactly what Jake of JakeOnline did, who in 2017 started to work on a parody of my own site, sadly the website was rarely updated and had months of no updates at all until around June 2018. As far as I can tell, the website went offline pre-2018-07-08. As Jake used content from my own site which is [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0), it means that the OwlMale website uses the same license.

The site has now been deleted thanks to our friendship ending, but when it was online, I would mirror the contents by using [HTTrack](http://www.httrack.com), grabbing the site a few number of times during its lifetime.

As [I already made a mirror of OwlMale on my website](https://owlman.neocities.org/owlmale), I thought I might as well do the same for [my GitHub](https://github.com/DynTylluan/owlmale.neocities.org) and [NotABug](https://notabug.org/DynTylluan/owlmale.neocities.org).
