# Mirror of owlmale.neocities.org
Due to [my website](https://owlman.neocities.org) having an open, Creative Comments license, it was (and still is) possible for people to mirror, edit, and build off of it, and that's exactly what Jake of JakeOnline did, who in 2017 started to work on a parody of my own site, sadly the website was rarely updated and had months of no updates at all until around June 2018. As far as I can tell, the website went offline pre-2018-07-08. As Jake used content from my own site which is [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0), it means that the OwlMale website uses the same license.

The site has now been deleted thanks to our friendship ending, but when it was online, I would mirror the contents by using [HTTrack](http://www.httrack.com), grabbing the site a few number of times during its lifetime.

As [I already made a mirror of OwlMale on my website](https://owlman.neocities.org/owlmale), I thought I might as well do the same for [my GitHub](https://github.com/DynTylluan/owlmale.neocities.org) and [NotABug](https://notabug.org/DynTylluan/owlmale.neocities.org).

# Disclaimer Regarding This Project
Just because I have mirrored a project by another person, this **does not mean** in any way, shape, or form that I agree or support the views of this project or even the person who made it, I have simply mirrored it for historical reasons as I have an interest in digital preservation. Over the years I have taken the time to archive many items, much of which can be seen [on my Internet Archive user page](https://archive.org/details/@14jammar). Following this, just because I have mirrored a project, this also does not mean that the author endorses me or my work.

If you are reading this and are wondering why exactly [that this disclaimer](https://github.com/DynTylluan/disclaimer) is inside of this project, it is simply here as a blanket way for getting out of trouble if myself or the project owner gets into hot water in some way, just in case. This is a standard text that is in all of [my GitHub](https://github.com/DynTylluan) mirrors and _does not automatically_ mean that the project owner is a bad person or is untrustworthy.

You are welcome to delete this file, as it will not affect the main part of the project in any way.
